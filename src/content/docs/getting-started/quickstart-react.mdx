# Quick Start: ReAct Agent

Build a tool-using agent that reasons and acts in a loop.

## What You'll Build

A ReAct agent that:
1. Takes user input
2. Reasons about what tool to use
3. Calls tools and observes results
4. Continues until it has a final answer

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ installed
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)

## Setup

Create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new my-agent
cd my-agent
```

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
wesichain-core = "0.1.0"
wesichain-graph = "0.1.0"
wesichain-llm = "0.1.0"
```

## Run It

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
cargo run
```
