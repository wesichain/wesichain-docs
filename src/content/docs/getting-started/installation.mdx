# Installation

Wesichain is a modular Rust workspace. Install only the crates you need.

## Requirements

- Rust `1.75+`
- Tokio runtime for async execution

## Minimal Agent/Graph Setup

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
wesichain-core = "0.2.1"
wesichain-llm = "0.2.1"
wesichain-graph = "0.2.1"
```

## Add Retrieval / RAG

```toml
[dependencies]
wesichain-retrieval = "0.2.1"
wesichain-rag = "0.2.1"
```

## Add Checkpoint Persistence

```toml
[dependencies]
wesichain-checkpoint-sqlite = "0.2.1"   # local/embedded
# or
wesichain-checkpoint-postgres = "0.2.1" # production DB
# or
wesichain-checkpoint-redis = "0.2.1"    # low-latency cache/session flows
```

## Crate Catalog

See the [Crate Selector](/crate-selector) for guided recommendations.

## Notes

- The framework is modular-first; avoid installing crates you do not need.
- `ReActGraphBuilder` is the recommended entry point for tool-using ReAct workflows.
- `ReActAgentNode` remains available for compatibility but is no longer the preferred path.
